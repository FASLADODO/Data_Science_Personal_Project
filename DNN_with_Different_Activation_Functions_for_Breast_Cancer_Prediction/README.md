# Deep Neural Networks with Different Activation Functions for Breast Cancer Prediction

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to apply deep neural networks for the breast cancer prediction, namely whether the tumor is benign or malignant. 

One of the hyperparameter will be fined tuned, which is the type of activation functions between hidden layers. The activation functions that will be tuned in this project are ReLu, sigmoid, and tanh functions and see which activation functions yield to the best prediction of the breast cancer.

The data used in this project was taken from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer datasets, available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29. Overall, there are 569 examples of tumor with different size of radius, texture, concavity, smoothness, and compactness available.
