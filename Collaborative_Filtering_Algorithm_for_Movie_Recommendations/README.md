# Collaborative Filtering for Movie Recommendations
## Objective

The main objective of this personal project is to build a movie recommender system using collaborative filtering algorithm. The dataset being used in this project is taken from [MovieLens 100K](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) datasets. The datasets first need to be cleaned up and manipulated before the algorthm can be applied. At the end, the movie recommendation based on user's rating on different set of movies will be shown.

## Files
There are five files in this project, consist of two Python files, two Text files, and one Jupyter Notebook file.
* Collaborative_Filtering_Algorithm_for_Movie_Recommendations.ipynb - This Jupyter file contains a step-by-step report and the corresponding result obtained in this project.
* main.py - This is the main Python file being used for this project.
* function.py -  Contains several functions needed by the main file to complete the project.
* RawData.txt -  Contains the raw dataset from MovieLens, consists of userID, movieID, and user's rating.
* movie_ids.txt - Contains the list of the movies used in this dataset.
