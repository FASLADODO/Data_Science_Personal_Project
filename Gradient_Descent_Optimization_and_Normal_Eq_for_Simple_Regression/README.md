# Gradient Descent Optimization and Normal Equation for Simple Regression Case

## Objective
The objective of this personal project is to prove the mathematical approach of gradient descent optimization as well as normal equation in order to find the global optimum solution in a simple univariate regression case. 
The result obtained from the mathematical derivation then will be compared with the result obtained from Scikit-learn library.
