# Statistical Inference - Residents' Opinion on US' Effort to Halt Crime Rates

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and statistical inference with the dataset gathered from the General Social Survey (GSS).
The main focus within this project is to observe whether there is an association between resident's opinion about US' effort to halt the rising crime rate with each of this two variables: 

1. the ownership of a gun and 
2. residents' fear of walking at night in their neighborhood.
