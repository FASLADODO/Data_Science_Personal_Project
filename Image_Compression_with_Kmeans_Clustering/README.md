# Image Compression with K-means Clustering

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to is to create an algorithm that can be useful to compress an image with the help of k-means clustering method. 

The image that will be compressed can be any size and we can also choose by how many colors the image will be represented. The less the colors to represent the image, the lower the size in bytes of the image. Below is the result of image compression in this project:
