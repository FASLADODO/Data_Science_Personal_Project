# Adam, RMSProp, and Momentum Optimizer Mini-Batch Gradient Descent in Deep Neural Networks for Breats Cancer Prediction

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to apply Adam, RMSProp, and Momentum optimizer in deep neural networks for the breast cancer prediction, namely whether the tumor is benign or malignant.

The F1-score result between each optimizer will be compared in the end of the project. 

The data used in this project was taken from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer datasets, available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29. Overall, there are 569 examples of tumor with different size of radius, texture, concavity, smoothness, and compactness available.
