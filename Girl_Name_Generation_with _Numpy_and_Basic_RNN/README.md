# Girl Name Generation with Numpy and Basic RNN

## Objective

Imagine there is a young couple expecting the born of their first baby child. They soon find out that the baby will be a girl but they are not sure yet what to name her. The purpose of this project is to generate girl name recommendation with the help of character level basic and simple RNN architecture. 

Because the low level API using numpy will be applied, then the very simple one layer RNN architecture is applied to avoid the overly complex algorithm. A text file contains about 3000 girl names is provided and can be seen from this GitHub repo https://github.com/dominictarr/random-name/blob/master/first-names.txt.

Below is the example of the result obtained in this project:

## Files

There are three different files in this project, which are:

- Girl_Name_Generation.ipynb -  Jupyter Notebook documentation of thsi project, which contains step-by-step explanation of the method used in this project.
- function.py - collection of Python functions used in this project.
- girl_name.txt - input file or corpus used in this project.
