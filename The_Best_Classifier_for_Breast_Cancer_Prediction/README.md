# The Best Classifier for Breast Cancer Prediction

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to find the best classifier in machine leatning to predict the severity of the breast cancer: whether the tumor is benign or malignant. The binary classifiers that will be used in this project are: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression.

The data used in this project was taken from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer datasets, available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29. Overall, there are 569 examples of tumor with different size of radius, texture, concavity, smoothness, and compactness available.
